======================

This checklist helps get you through installing ArcGIS for Server, Portal for ArcGIS, and an enterprise geodatabase in PostgreSQL.

Checking or unchecking a box will not store anything anywhere. If someone would like to come up with a *simple* solution for preserving the state of each box, please [fork this repo](https://github.com/garys-esri/arcgis-setup-checklist/fork) and create a pull request. I suggest a cookie-based solution.

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to submit an issue or, better yet, [fork this repo](https://github.com/garys-esri/arcgis-setup-checklist/fork) and create a pull request.
